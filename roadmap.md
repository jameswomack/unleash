### Next Steps
* Tech blog post draft
* Talk with Ben about standardization of Angular release convention. Where will this spec be communicated? What is a tool for validating against this spec? (https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)
* Integrate logo from 99 Designs, color scheme and better marketing language in this document
* Add pertinent badges such as build status
* Introduce "In the Wild" section
* Get legal review
* Check health of project against bithound

### Technical Roadmap
* Make option flags clearer
* Improve dry run by showing a pretty diff of changes that'd occur, including actual file contents
* Guess which type of release should happen based on commit messages
* Check for outdated & unused dependencies
* Look into supporting multi-module releases e.g. Lodash, Babel, React
